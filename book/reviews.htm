"In <I>How To Make Money Without Money</I>, entrepreneur and financier Jacob Katsman shows the reader how to negotiate international trade transactions with minimal risk and no investment; prepare documents for the bank under 'Letters of Credit'; start an import/export business; obtain exclusive rights for products; and find trading opportunities through the Internet.  Practical, informative, articulate, <I>How To Make Money Without Money</I> is essential for the novice with limited or no capital, and has much of great value to offer even the more experienced trader and internationally oriented entrepreneur faced with capital investment restrictions."<P>

<B>Review by Gregory Bresinger of Independent Publisher :</B><BR>
" 'It takes money to make money.' So the old saw goes.  Well, not necessarily, according to Jacob Katsman, an international trader and financier.  Katsman, who thought he was headed for a career in law or journalism, probably prefers 'knowledge is power' as his favorite saw.  Katsman, was told by his father to find out what a letter of credit was.  The Iron Curtain had come down and a new era of international trade had dawned.

<P>A few months later he was knee deep in international trading and never has looked back.  He has co-founded a commodity exchange on the Internet called the Continental Community Exchange.

<P>With a 'you can do too' philosophy, Katsman details a step by step process that he claims can transform almost anyone into an international trader, a business person with access to 'a million dollars' of credit.  With the right training, or maybe the right padre, almost anyone can become an international trader, he says.

<P>'After ten years of sleepless nights,' Katsman writes, "travelling all over the world, meeting interesting people, and moving tons of a variety of products across the globe, I thank my father for opening the door to the real world and guiding me through the obstacles that lay ahead.' "<P>
