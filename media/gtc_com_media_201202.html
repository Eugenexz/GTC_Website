  Technology group Safran has selected GTC&rsquo;s  @GlobalTrade multi-bank trade finance platform for monitoring issued and  received bank guarantees and documentary credits.<br>
  <br>
  GTC's software will enable Safran to connect to its multiple banks through  SwiftNet using MT 798 messages and will be interfaced with Safran&rsquo;s internal  systems.<br>
  <br>
  "The MT 798 is used in the corporate-to-bank environment to cater for import  letters of&nbsp;credit, export letters of&nbsp;credit&nbsp;and  guarantees/standby letters of credit," Andre Casterman, head of trade and  supply chain at Swift tells&nbsp;<b>GTR</b>.<br>
  <br>
  <br>"@GlobalTrade&nbsp;system will allow Safran to achieve end-to-end automation of  trade finance activities while complying with its stringent security policies,&rdquo;  says Nick Pachnev, GTC's chief technology officer.<br>
  <br>
"Highly configurable and modular design of @GlobalTrade system provides a  standard solution for such critical requirements as centralised user identity  management, flexible authorisation process and electronic multibank  connectivity," Pachnev adds.
