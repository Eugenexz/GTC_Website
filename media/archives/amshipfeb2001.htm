<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>

</span></div>


<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-CA><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>For many, holding onto an original paper document like a
bill of lading or a letter of credit has been like clutching a security
blanket.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Conventional wisdom was that bills of lading and
documentary credit practices provided the safeguards that shippers needed to do
business with, and ensure payment from, trade counterparts overseas.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>But besides depleting forests around the world, paper-based
processes are increasingly perceived as slow, cumbersome and error-prone.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Finding an electronic substitute that would still be
acceptable to banks, insurers and shippers has become a priority. In fact, with
commerce’s added impetus, many companies involved in ocean shipping, including
third parties such as trade facilitators, have looked for a new way of handling
trade transactions and payments electronically.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>John Leitner, president of California-based customs
brokerage and forwarding company W.J. Byrnes, said he has seen &quot;constant
problems&quot; with documentary credit. Banks reject the letter of credit if
there is any discrepancy between the different documents, or they hold on to
the documents, causing shipment delays.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>&quot;A lot of people blame the banks,&quot; he said,
adding banks &quot;do not know&quot; the details of the export and import transactions.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>While the documentary letter of credit, as a document of
title, remains paper-based, all other documents can be converted into
electronic messages. For a paperless bill of lading, traders would have to
agree to use a document that is equivalent to a B/L, governed by special
contract rules.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>This paper B/L issue has led many in the shipping and
banking sectors to say the B/L stands in the way of electronic progress.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Under the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary
Credits 500 rules established by the International Chamber of Commerce, better
known as the UCP500 rules, a letter of credit also requires the physical
presentation of a bill of lading, or a non-negotiable sea waybill, to trigger
the payment to the exporter by the importer’s bank.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>&quot;Electronic commerce requires a faster speed,&quot;
said Philippe Rapatout, adviser to the logistics division of chemical group
Atofina and a member of several committees of the International Chamber of
Commerce.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Current banking practices remain &quot;a major obstacle&quot;
to the development of international commerce, particularly electronic commerce,
Rapatout added.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Setting up an electronic marketplace on the Internet
&quot;is the easy part,&quot; said Peter Scott, commercial director of
Bolero.net, an electronic document communications provider. Providing a secure
network for communication is often missing from these Web sites.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Doing business electronically is also a requirement of
shippers. &quot;Increasingly, shippers want an electronic environment&quot; to
conduct transactions, Brian Moulton, global shipping director of Michelin, said
at the recent Intermodal 2000 conference in Genoa.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>But the question is: How can traders obtain the same level
of security as letters of credit and B/Ls, without all the associated paper
documents, and with e-commerce speed?</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:"Arial Black"'>Different Approaches.</span><span
lang=EN-CA>&nbsp;Shippers, forwarders, customs brokers and banks say it’s
obvious that there is a need to solve the problem of the flow of data and money
in international trade. Oceanborne goods create the additional burden associated
with negotiable, paper-based bills of lading.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Electronic trade facilitators like Bolero.net, CCEWeb and
TradeCard have been established in the last few years, offering electronic
products they hope will replace paper-based processes. These companies specialize
in one or several key areas: secure document transfers, document management,
credit rating, trade financing and payments. Other third-party e-commerce firms
specialize in electronic identification and digital signatures.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>These new third-party e-commerce firms and others are
trying to provide a common electronic platform to integrate trade, banking and
transport processes and documents. But their approaches are very different,
particularly in the way they integrate all the different facets of international
trade and how their proposed electronic systems deviate from current practices.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:"Arial Black"'>Bolero.net.</span><span
lang=EN-CA>&nbsp;One of the early innovators in e-commerce for international
trade and shipping, London-based e-commerce firm Bolero.net provides an
electronic trade documents communications system.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>The backbone of the Bolero.net system is a core messaging
platform, which enables users to exchange electronic trade documents via the
Internet, including negotiable electronic bills of lading. All messages and
document transfers are encrypted and acknowledged. By providing what it calls a
&quot;title registry,&quot; Bolero.net replicates the function of a bill of
lading as a document of title — in other words, ownership of the goods
represented by the bill of lading can be electronically transferred between
Bolero.net users.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Contrary to TradeCard and other international e-commerce
systems, Bolero.net is based on the expectation that shippers will still
require the use of bills of lading as a document of title. Others argue that it
is time for ocean shipping and its users to switch to sea waybills, which are
not documents of title.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>&quot;The entire Bolero system was created to maintain the
current system of ocean bills of lading,&quot; said Rapatout, at Atofina.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Bolero.net has signed up major banks, shipping lines and
forwarders and is perceived as a big system for large corporate users.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Can shippers use Bolero.net to use electronic letters of
credit? &quot;Essentially, the answer is that, in a Bolero L/C transaction, all
parties are signatories to the Bolero Rule Book,&quot; said Ake Nilson, a
consultant to Bolero.net.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>&quot;The Rule Book is a contract under which, inter alia,
the parties agree to treat any electronic message as the equivalent of the
corresponding paper document. Therefore, when you combine the UCP500 rules with
the Bolero Rule Book, the end result is that the parties are prepared to accept
‘electronic B/Ls’ for the purposes of the L/C process,&quot; he explained. The
documentary requirements for letters of credit are &quot;pretty much the
same&quot; as in the paper world, he added.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:"Arial Black"'>CCEWeb.</span><span
lang=EN-CA>&nbsp;The Canadian e-commerce software firm has introduced an
electronic letter of credit card and an Internet-based trade payment, trade
processing and document management system.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>The service, called @GlobalTrade, combines the functionality
of a letter of credit with that of a credit card (November 2000 American
Shipper, page 44).</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>The key component of the product is what CCEWeb calls its
&quot;documentary clearance center.&quot; The center functions much like a
trade finance department of a bank. It centralizes and oversees all types of
trade, transport, insurance and financial documents and effectively takes on
part of the role of the bank that issues a letter of credit.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>CCEWeb said its documentary clearance center processes all
events relating to documentary letter of credit and provides trade processing
services to the trade parties, the bank and all related parties in the trade
cycle.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Letters of credit are payable through the documentary
clearance center. The center will check documents presented by the beneficiary
for compliance and complete the trade cycle by paying the beneficiary. More
detailed information on how the integrated CCEWeb electronic system works is
posted at www.cceweb.com.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Like Bolero.net, CCEWeb runs a secure electronic platform. However,
CCEWeb does not operate a &quot;title registry&quot; to govern the ownership of
goods between trade parties. It can work with paper bills of lading and with
waybills. CCEWeb has written certain binding clauses in its waybills to provide
to users some of the legal protection associated with bills of lading,</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>&quot;Our system is able to handle both traditional bills
of lading and the waybill, which bears three clauses which will offer
protection to banks and carriers,&quot; said Arthur O. Thomas, senior vice
president, business development at CCEWeb. &quot;I don’t think you can get away
from the traditional bills of lading in all cases. But practice will reduce
recourse to traditional bills of lading.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>&quot;The system that we have developed incorporates the
possibility of the transport document required being a waybill, whilst
retaining the security of payment inherent in the documentary credit
process,&quot; he said.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>CCEWeb said its @GlobalTrade product brings together all
parties in a trade chain &quot;to the same electronic page.&quot; This includes
ocean and air carriers, freight forwarders, customs brokers, surveyors,
third-party logistics providers, banks, chambers of commerce, insurance
companies and financial institutions.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>&quot;@GlobalTrade is about evolution rather than
revolution of trade processing,&quot; Thomas said. &quot;Our solution is to
work with customers at their speed of comfort, move into this new e-space
bringing people along, allowing users to use the existing paper practices if
they have to, going digital where they can.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>CCEWeb employs staff that check all the documents for
compliance manually, before authorizing payments to the seller.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Compared to the usual way of conducting trade transactions,
Thomas said that @GlobalTrade makes the payment process faster, guarantees
irrevocable funds availability, authenticates customers’ and trade service
providers’ identities, and integrates invoices, transport documents and
payments.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>For users, CCEWeb has lower setup fees and annual fees than
Bolero.net and transaction fees charged by CCEWeb &quot;will be lower than what
importers and exporters pay to their respective banks today,&quot; Thomas said.
And, unlike Bolero.net, CCEWeb describes itself a complete end-to-end solution.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>One key role of CCEWeb may be its ability to enable buyers
and sellers, through the @GlobalTrade system, to finance trade deals over the
Internet. A pilot to introduce @GlobalTrade began in November and CCEWeb plans
to launch it commercially in the fall.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:"Arial Black"'>TradeCard.</span><span
lang=EN-CA> New York-based e-commerce firm TradeCard (www.tradecard.com)
provides a trade document management and innovative financial settlement
service that equates to an electronic letter of credit.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>To use TradeCard’s patented transaction system, buyers and
sellers must first become approved TradeCard members. To begin a transaction,
the buyer creates an electronic purchase order, either through the TradeCard
system using its contract templates, via electronic file from a company’s ERP
system, or from an online marketplace. TradeCard then notifies the seller that
there is a purchase order pending for review. The buyer and seller can further
negotiate the purchase order online. Once they agree to the terms, both buyer
and seller authorize the purchase order with digital signatures.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>TradeCard’s Internet-based database populates all the required
trade and other documents, using data from the original information.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Once the packing list and invoice have been created and
authenticated by the seller, an assurance of payment is attached to the
purchase order, confirming the amount of coverage on the shipment, and ensuring
that the seller will receive payment upon document compliance.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>TradeCard’s patented compliance engine then electronically
compares the data from the electronically submitted shipping documents to the
original purchase order. Once compliance is met, payment is transferred
electronically from the buyer’s financial institution to the seller’s financial
institution.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Like CCEWeb, TradeCard takes on part of the role of the
trade finance department of a bank and integrates numerous trade, transport and
other documents. TradeCard differs in that it has an automated compliance
engine, is more electronic, and its financial settlement does not use letters
of credit.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>&quot;TradeCard is an alternative to a letter of
credit,&quot; said Kurt Cavano, chief executive officer of the company.
&quot;We do everything that a letter of credit does, but we do it without
paper.&quot; Working with TradeCard, the credit rating and insurance firm
Coface is responsible for rating new users of the system, who must apply for
credit the same way they would deal with a bank.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>The TradeCard compliance system will check that the
information on the purchase order, the proof of delivery (bills of lading are
not used), the insurance certificate and other document match, before
authorizing payment to the seller.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Cavano said that TradeCard is considerably cheaper than a
traditional bank letter of credit, and it still guarantees payments. His
company also provides supply chain visibility. &quot;You cannot do that with a
bank,&quot; he added. TradeCard users can keep their bank to do business via
the electronic trade platform.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>TradeCard can be used for oceanborne as well as for
airborne goods.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:"Arial Black"'>E-payment.</span><span
lang=EN-CA>&nbsp;In the business-to-business e-commerce world, payment is often
a missing link in online transactions. But overseas buyers and sellers doing
business on the Internet often don’t know each other, and this raises questions
about security of payment.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>In a recent report on &quot;E-global logistics,&quot; the
U.S. financial firm Stephens Inc. said that &quot;traditional settlement
methods are not suitable for Internet-based transactions.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>This market gap explains some of the products introduced by
TradeCard and CCEWeb.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Meanwhile, Bolero.net is planning to start an electronic
settlement utility for managing finance. The planned product would incorporate
aspects of existing settlement methods, such as document compliance checking
and the Bolero electronic bill of lading.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:"Arial Black"'>Review Of L/C Rules.</span><span
lang=EN-CA>&nbsp;Under current rules of 1994 of the International Chamber of
Commerce on letters of credit, an original paper bill of lading or sea waybill
must be produced, for oceanborne shipments, before the bank will authorize
payment.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>The International Chamber of Commerce’s Banking Commission
is considering an &quot;electronic supplement&quot; to its rules on documentary
credits.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>The &quot;eUCP,&quot; as it has been termed, would be
attached to the ICC’s universally recognized rules on letters of credit, UCP
500. &quot;The market is looking to the ICC for guidance on how to deal with
electronic documents,&quot; said Dan Taylor, vice president of the Banking
Commission.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>&quot;New Web sites are sprouting all the time, claiming to
provide all the tools to complete trade transactions online,&quot; a spokesman
for the International Chamber of Commerce said. The ICC believes that these
developments will accelerate. The trade body’s Banking Commission has decided
that it is in the best interests of the parties to have Uniform Customs and
Practice for Documentary Credits rules flexible enough to handle e-commerce
transactions.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>&quot;This amounts to nothing less than a revolution in
trade finance,&quot; the ICC spokesman added.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>&quot;The ICC itself is currently reviewing the UCP500
rules with a view to producing an addendum to the UCP500, which will
effectively ‘legalize’ the use of electronic documents even without the action
of separate agreements, such as the Bolero Rule Book,&quot; said Nilson, at
Bolero.net. The eUCP addendum is expected to be ready by May.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Knut Pontopiddan, the senior regulatory affairs executive
of the A.P. Moller shipping group who chairs the Maritime Transport Commission
of the International Chamber of Commerce, said he supports the electronic
initiative on documentary credit.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>The Maritime Transport Commission of the ICC will assist
the trade body’s banking commission and is putting together a group of experts
to provide views on the proposed electronic letters of credit documentary
changes, he said.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>E-commerce trade facilitators that have thrived because of
the inadequacy of current documentary credit banking rules believe they will
survive the banking reform of the ICC concerning letters of credit.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>&quot;We plan to use the eUCP 500,&quot; said Thomas, at
CCEWeb. &quot;@Global Trade is compatible with the current UCP500 and will be
fully compatible with current ICC initiatives regarding an eUCP and our legal
team is drafting a User Agreement that all parties will sign online.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:"Arial Black"'>Carriers, Forwarders.</span><span
lang=EN-CA> Ocean carriers, forwarders and customs brokers should benefit from
the new electronic products and from the move away from paper-based documents.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Carriers have wanted to get out of the business of
producing negotiable paper bills of lading as documents of title for a long
time.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>The use of sea waybills removes the risk of documents being
held up in the trade chain, causing delays to shipments.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>&quot;The move will be to electronic waybills,&quot; said
Leitner. &quot;Once the customers are comfortable with waybills, they’ll be
using them.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Many of the new electronic products and initiatives point
to a greater use of electronic sea waybills or even simplified &quot;proof of
delivery messages.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>For example, TradeCard uses air waybills as the proof of
delivery of the goods for airborne cargoes. For ocean shipping, TradeCard
allows forwarders to send, as the proof of delivery, an &quot;856&quot; EDI
message. This message type contains some of the information found on a sea
waybill.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>&quot;We try to make the impact (of our processes) on
shipping lines and forwarders as easy as possible,&quot; said Cavano, at
TradeCard. He said that simplified Internet documents are used.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>For example, Cavano said that TradeCard sends invoice
details from its system to Fritz Cos., saving the forwarder and customs broker
a lot of re-keying of information.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Patrick Burrows, general manager of marketing systems,
business systems division P&amp;O Nedlloyd, said the use of the electronic
system CCEWeb by shippers would lead to several benefits for shipping lines. He
cited higher productivity for data entry into the carrier’s internal system,
encouraging users to switch from bills of lading to waybills, and automating
the collection of freight revenues. CCEWeb can &quot;reserve an amount&quot; of
the seller/buyer transaction to pay the carrier, Burrows said.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>Leitner, an advisor to CCEWeb, said that a customs broker
using the company’s system can do a timely check of the description of goods on
the commercial invoice of the exporter. This ensures that the description meets
the requirements for Customs clearance.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>For shippers and forwarders, many of the electronic trade
facilitation systems and initiatives sound complex, and it is too early to say
whether they will have the critical mass to make any system an industry
standard. The likelihood is that there will be several systems that will run
alongside the current paper-based systems.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>&quot;For quite some time you’re going to have a
combination of paper as well as the electronic data interchange,&quot; said
Thomas, at CCEWeb.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-CA>However, the evidence suggests that the investment required
to sign up and set up these electronic trade facilitation systems, for shippers
and their providers, will pay off. Their successful implementation in international
commerce could integrate, simplify and accelerate many international
transactions.</span></p>
