<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:right'><b><span
style='font-size:7.5pt;font-family:Verdana;

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>A Canadian company has
teamed up with Adobe Systems of San Jose, Calif., in a bid to change the
standard format for international trade documentation and settlements, while
keeping the old rules intact.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Jacob Katsman, chief
executive of Toronto's CCEWeb, says the @GlobalTrade product, still in its test
phase, will use Adobe's PDF standard to cut down on the time and money it takes
to process paper forms during international transactions.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;Our job is to allow
international trade to be done electronically. Today, it involves a lot of
paperwork,&quot; Katsman says. So much so that, according to a press release
from Adobe and CCEWeb, the United Nations pegs the cost of processing
trade-related forms at US$640 billion each year.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>CCEWeb picked Adobe's PDF
standard because of its ubiquity - about 350 million people use Acrobat Reader,
based on free downloads from Adobe's site and installations at its OEM partners
- as well as its encryption and authentication features, says Mark James,
Adobe's e-paper business development manager.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>In addition, Adobe's use of
XML, which allows documents to be dynamic and update themselves automatically,
even filling in fields as values change, was a key benefit, Katsman says. He
explains that even the tiniest mistake in a paper copy of a form can hold up a
shipment, driving up costs. With paper, the only thing you can do is correct
the mistake and send out a new document by courier or fax; many banks also
charge a fee for paperwork errors.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>@GlobalTrade's target
audience is the banking industry. Thus far, CCEWeb has won over German commerce
giant Dresdner Bank, as well as Singapore's Overseas Union Bank and the U.S.'s
Premier Bank. Nearly every major bank plays a part in international trade by
guaranteeing letters of credit for buyers and sellers in different countries.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>It's these letters of
credit, thousands of which are issued daily, that the program aims to move into
electronic format. In a typical international import-export deal, banks in both
the seller's and buyer's countries get involved, charging their own fees for
facilitating the trade. Under the @GlobalTrade model, only one bank needs to
get involved, to check the credit of the buyer.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Once a transaction has been
approved, the system sends copies of the documents to other parties in the
shipping chain, including insurance companies, customs brokers, and shipment
inspectors. After they're done, all documents are sent back to a document
clearance centre.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Although it sounds like it
could be manna for international trade, there are a few obstacles to
@GlobalTrade's adoption. Any technology-based solution has to keep the current
rules of trade intact, especially the 70-year-old UCP 500 rule book that
governs letters of credit and similar documents.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Adobe's James, who's been
working with CCEWeb for a year and a half on the project, says another obstacle
is the varying levels of technological sophistication around the world.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;In a lot of
countries, they're just now starting to get the infrastructure to join this
sort of global, e-business process,&quot; James says, whereas in Canada, the
Customs and Revenue Agency has been using PDF forms for tax filing and other
documentation for some time. CBIZ </span></p>
