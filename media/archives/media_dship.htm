<h1>DOCUMENTATION GOES ELECTRIC</h1>

<h2>CCEWeb And Bolero Are Leading Initiatives To Make Maritime Electronic
Paperwork Easier</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Security
in international trade is not easy. Not many people would feel comfortable
shipping container loads of goods to someone halfway around the world who they
have only met on the internet; not many people would feel comfortable buying
goods from someone halfway around the world they have only met on the internet
either for that matter. Any disagreement over payment or quality of goods received
generally proves extremely expensive and difficult to resolve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>There are
several well-developed financial mechanisms to improve security in these
transactions. The most trusted is the &quot;letter of credit,&quot; a document
which banks produce, which means that the importer's bank guarantees to pay the
exporter for the goods at a predefined point after they are loaded on the
vessel; there is no question of waiting until the importer has received the
goods and has determined that he is happy with them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The second
most important document is the bill of lading; the holder of this document can
enforce delivery of the goods as they pass through the transport chain; if the
goods are retraded whilst en route, the bill of lading is passed from the
seller to the buyer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>An
alternative to the bill of lading is the &quot;waybill,&quot; this document
which includes all details about the shipment but is not traded in the same way
as the bill of lading and is less suitable for goods which may be traded en
route. It is intended for importers and exporters who do business regularly,
trust each other and do not feel the need for such security for payment and
delivery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
problem with all of this documentation is that, at this point at least, most of
it is on paper. Although the mechanisms have been developed over hundreds of
years, most companies and legislators still insist on seeing a piece of paper.
But paperwork of course is much more expensive and time consuming to produce
and transport, compared to electronic documents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Considering
how international trade is increasingly being made electronically, the
requirements to generate paperwork to support shipments looks increasingly
daft. But its difficult to change the international systems which surround the
paper, developed over so much time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>Creating the documentation</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The dream
of electronic documentation is enough to make all of the people who spend all
day typing it out go a little giddy. Computers can automatically create
paperwork, send it and read it, and people can carry on working on the more
interesting parts of the job.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>A further
advantage of electronic documents is that it is possible to remove discrepancy
problems. There have been times when the sender and receiver of the goods have
used different text formats, or spelt words in different ways, and this has led
to the recipient refusing to pay for the goods and having (albeit sketchy)
legal grounds for doing so, or goods being delayed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
development of electronic documentation is expected to be an arduous process,
with several different electronic systems running in parallel with existing
paper systems for a number of years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Two
companies, Bolero and CCEWeb, are forging ahead to make maritime electronic
paperwork easier and easier. The two companies are not mutually exclusive;
Bolero operates a secure, legally watertight and insured system for transfer of
electronic documents and messages, whilst CCEWeb has a system for putting
electronic documents together which complies with the existing rule book for
letters of credit UCP 500.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>Bolero</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Bolero, it
needs to be stressed, is at its heart a secure e-mailing system, checking all
e-mails through a central messaging hub, to ensure all messages arrive and
documents are not changed without the recipient noticing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
company is doing a great deal to build on this central hub. It has put together
a rulebook to ensure that messages have legal weight, with the involvement of
lawyers of the companies involved. It also has a cool $50m investment to build
applications that use the system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>A crucial
part of the Bolero system is its ability to manage the &quot;title
registry&quot; of the goods, i.e. the person who legitimately owns them at
various stages of the transport chain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>In
December 2000, Bolero announced the completion of $50m in its first
&quot;institutional&quot; round of funding. Companies recently signed up to use
the system include electronics company Hitachi; CoreMarkets, an e-marketplace
for raw materials for the steel industry; Banco Itaú, the second largest
private bank in Brazil; Australian bank Westpac; Tokio Marine and Fire (Japan),
Tokai Bank and Tate and Lyle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>Canadian CCEWeb</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Canadian
company CCEWeb has produced a Secure Payment and Trade Management System for
trade processing called @GlobalTrade. Shipping lines P&amp;O Nedlloyd, APL and
others have already agreed to the necessary clauses enabling the electronic
waybill to be used as replacement for negotiable bills of lading.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The pilot
project will begin in April 2001, leading to a commercial launch, in Autumn
2001. Exporters, importers, banks, carriers, freight forwarders and surveyors
can all use the system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>CCEWeb was
originally established in 1996 as an online marketplace for international
commodities. The business plan evolved to providing online letters of credit
and electronic document management when this proved a more realistic direction
for profitability of the business.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The idea
arose when Jacob Katsman, Chairman and CEO of CCEWeb read the P&amp;O Nedlloyd
Merchant's Guide, written by John Richardson. The document explained the complexities
involved in creating a letter of credit between importer, exporter and their
respective banks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>CCEWeb's
solution presents a mechanism for importers and exporters to put their
documentation together over the internet; once completed, the document can be
printed out as an unchangeable Adobe portable document format (pdf) file.  The file is then further secured with a
digital signature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The CCEWeb
solution is further enhanced by its close links to credit card organisation
Visa International. Visa is considered to have convenient mechanisms in place
for fast settlement of funds with over 20,000 Member banks.  Visa International is currently working on a
new platform that will enable B2B e-commerce for its Members.  Credit cards are widely thought to have been
a major fuel to the online business to consumer market. CCEWeb hopes that by
creating a suitable payment system for international trade, it can fuel to B2B
online market in a similar way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Within the
CCEWeb system, shipping lines generate electronic waybills, which go alongside
other documentation normally required for letter of credit payments, including
packing lists, certificates of origin and commercial invoices.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Shipping
lines are particularly interested in getting involved in a CCEWeb transaction
chain, because they get closer to the transfer of funds between buyer and
seller and hence can find it easier to collect their freight payments.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Customs
brokers can be granted access to the system, enabling them to check the
description of the goods on the commercial invoice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>About the staff</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>CCEWeb has
a powerful maritime pedigree in its staff. John Richardson, director of
transportation and logistics, has recently retired from shipping line P&amp;O
Nedlloyd after a 45-year career in shipping, 30 of which have been with P&amp;O
Nedlloyd and its predecessors. He is author of the P&amp;O Nedlloyd's
Merchants' Guide, the Guide to Hague and Hague Visby Rules, the Guide to
BOXTIME Charter party and Combined Transport Documents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Art
Thomas, senior vice president of business development, was previously manager
of trade and regulatory affairs with APL. At APL he was also manager of export
documentation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Jacob
Katsman Chairman &amp; CEO has practical experience in trade finance and
logistics having managed trading companies in Asia, Europe and North America.
He is a co-founder of L/C Monitor, a monthly print and online publication
covering practical use of payment instruments in international trade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>@GlobalTrade
does not require any specialist software to run on the user's computer. This
means it is relatively easy to implement between different users of a supply
chain, once the bank has granted acceptance of it, since everybody has an
internet browser.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The buyer
comes to the service equipped with either an eLC Card or a credit line granted
by his/her bank.  The Documentary
Clearance Center (DCC) acting in @GlobalTrade System as an independent
processing centre for multiple financial institutions checks with the buyer's
bank, that the buyer has sufficient credit and once this is established advises
the credit directly to the exporter via the Internet.  The communication of documents could also be in XML format, so it
is relatively easy to program an interface between @GlobalTrade and a company's
existing in-house system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
documents can finally be issued as an encrypted and digitally signed pdf. Thus
the document can only be seen by the intended recipient; it is not possible for
anybody to alter it; and it is possible to securely identify the sender.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Any other
documents, if in electronic form, can be uploaded to the system from a web
browser and delivered to the DCC.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The data
is automatically sent to parties who need to produce documentation; for
example, the carrier is advised of data needed to complete the waybill or bill
of lading.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Some of
CCEWeb’s alliance partners include Indentrus, which provides electronic
identity verification, and Authentica, which enables users to retain ownership
and control of electronic documents. The buyer can thus verify electronically
that merchandise has been shipped on time and the quantities and agreed.</span></p>

<h3>CCEWeb and Dresdner Bank</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>CCEWeb
recently announced that  Dresdner Bank
(Germany) will pilot the use of its Documentary Clearance Center (DCC). The
system will be implemented by the bank's Transaction Banking Division.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The pilot

carriers, freight forwarders, customs brokers, surveyors and other parties in
making trade transactions.</span></p>

<h3>TradeCard</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>TradeCard
is a New York-based business, which provides an electronic trade document
management and financial settlement service. Buyers can complete documents
onboard the computer, using special templates or file uploading; the buyer and
seller can negotiate the purchase order online; once they agree to terms they
can &quot;sign&quot; the order using digital signatures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Once the
seller has created a packing list and invoice, an assurance of payment is
attached to the purchase order, assuring the seller that payment will be made
on receipt of the shipping documents (proof of delivery, insurance certificate
and other documents), once they have been checked against the purchase order.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
ambition of TradeCard is to replace the letter of credit, doing everything the
letter of credit does but without paper. TradeCard works closely with credit
rating and insurance company Coface, which rates new users of the system. They
apply for credit similarly to the way they would apply to a bank.</span></p>

<h3>BIMCO launches internet charter party editor</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>BIMCO (The
Baltic and International Maritime Council) has launched an online charter party
editor, codenamed ARION, enabling brokers and principals to edit and exchange
charter parties and other standard shipping documents online.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>ARION is
based on a specially customised version of Microsoft Word which loads into the
web browser, with the standard document templates being physically stored by
BIMCO the whole time, never in the user's computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>When the
user is satisfied with the completed document, BIMCO converts it to encrypted
portable document format (Adobe pdf) file, which cannot be altered and can only
be read by those authorised to see it. It is then e-mailed to the users for
printing out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>BIMCO asks
for a nominal annual charge for people to use the system (around $200), then
will charge $2-$3 per document completed using it, with no additional charge
made for draft copies of documents. A demonstration of the system can be viewed
on BIMCO's website (http://www.bimco.dk), click on &quot;ARION&quot; logo in
the bottom hand column of the screen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>This is a
vast improvement over traditional charter party writing, where even some of the
most technically advanced shipbrokers still employ secretaries to type final
charter parties onto paper forms using manual typewriters and Tippex.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>BIMCO is
in a very good position to offer this service; it already produces many of the
most popular charter party forms which are used in shipbroking around the
world, with over a hundred different forms suitable for different trades.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>The technicalities</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
service uses a customised version of Microsoft Word which functions over the
internet, with all files stored and hosted by BIMCO at all times. The system is
pre-loaded with templates for all of the standard charter party forms; the
template (underlying form) and associated text cannot be changed by the user.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The broker
can input the details into the form, and then alert the shipowner or charterer
to review them. Any changes or deletions which the other party wishes to make
to the document are tracked (the usual &quot;track changes&quot; feature in
Microsoft Word.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
changes are accepted into the body document once both sides have agreed to
them; it is always absolutely clear which changes to the text have been agreed
by both parties and which changes haven't. The &quot;track changes&quot;
feature cannot be turned off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>It is
possible to copy and paste text onto the templates; for example if a broking
house has in-house clauses which it always uses, it can store them in ARION’s
databases and then copy them onto the templates. Users can directly access
BIMCO's databases of standard clauses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
clauses of standard documents can be quickly cross-referenced using ARION’s
built-in hyperlinks which will take the user to any part of the form just by
clicking a Box or Clause reference in the text.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>All BIMCO
documents on the ARION system have the original Explanatory Notes built in to
the template providing users with instant guidance as to the intention of the
original drafters of the form.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Brokers
can put charter parties together by loading up a previous one out of the system
and editing it as necessary; they do not have to start creating each one from
scratch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Copies of
the final charter party are not printed out until the contents are confirmed by
both parties; any printouts made during interim stages are clearly marked
&quot;draft document.&quot; Having multiple printouts of different
&quot;final&quot; versions in circulation would prove very confusing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>When both
parties are happy with the document, BIMCO automatically converts it to pdf
format and e-mails it to the respective parties; it is only that this point
that BIMCO charges the user for the service. To ensure security, all documents
are sent using 128 bit encryption, and can only be sent to e-mail addresses
which have been registered in advance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The system
is not only restricted to putting together charter parties; it can be used for
any kind of documentation, provided BIMCO has the form templates on its system.
&quot;Our current system has 67 templates documents in it, including charter
parties, bills of lading, ship management and crew management agreements,&quot;
says Grant Hunter, head of the documentary and legal division with BIMCO.  &quot;Users will just go in and find a
catalogue of BIMCO Approved Forms and third party forms. It will be a very
comprehensive system.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>It is
necessary for users to have a license for Microsoft Word, although the
application does not make use of the Microsoft Word software running on their
computers; all of the document editing software is downloaded from BIMCO every
time.</span></p>

<h3>Developing the system</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
web-enabled charter party editor could be considered as an upgrade from BIMCO's
previous charter party editing software, which it supplied as a CD-ROM and ran
on individual computers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;The
problem we had more than anything was that once a fault had been identified
with the software, you had to send out a patch or an update every single
time,&quot; comments Mr Hunter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Other
problems with this software were that it was impossible to e-mail documents
directly to other parties (unless they were also using the BIMCO software);
they had to be printed out and faxed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The new
web-enabled system does not restrict itself to only offering BIMCO-standard
forms, as the old system does; all popular maritime forms are included.
&quot;That will be very appealing to brokers,&quot; comments Mr Hunter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>A
potential business opportunity, which hasn't escaped BIMCO's notice, is
extending the system to allow users to complete transactions over it.
&quot;We've allowed for this development,&quot; he says.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>It is
possible to extend the functionality in future to allow broker and shipowner to
see the document being edited simultaneously. For example, the broker and the
shipowner could be on the telephone whilst simultaneously editing the document.
The system could be set up so that the broker types in all the changes, the
shipowner can see the changes being made on the screen but cannot make any
changes himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&quot;What
we want to do when we first launch the product is make it as simple as
possible,&quot; comments Mr Hunter. &quot;It's going out as a simple editor to
begin with.  But we reserve the right to
add much greater functionality as time goes on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial'>BIMCO has
held discussions with possible e-chartering site LevelSeas about including the
charter party editor into the LevelSeas system. &quot;Because they' re looking
for life of the voyage applications, I think that's the way it would go,&quot;
says Mr Hunter. &quot;We would like to see the application integrated with
other systems.&quot;</span></p>
