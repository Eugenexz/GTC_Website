<h1>By: Jacob Katsman</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>A blink of an eye and we are now in 2002.  Looking back at what happened with trade
services in 2001, we find a few things that are noteworthy and should make us
stop and think about the future.  One of
these is the Supplement to the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary
Credits for Electronic Presentation, better know as eUCP, which should come
into force on April 1, 2002.   For most
banks, the carryover question from the last year is, ‘what are we going to do
with trade services in general?’  Are we
going to outsource our trade processing operations in whole or in part to
another bank or company?  Are we going
to maintain our status quo and continue to serve our own customers, or are we
going to expand our trade services business and insource business from other
banks?   Other issues on the 2002 agenda
include e-commerce solutions for trade, digital identities for corporate
customers, and standards.   </span></p>

Operations</span></b></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>Centralization of trade processing operations will continue
through 2002 for banks with large domestic and overseas branch networks.  Many banks are in the process of
establishing regional processing centres in low cost regions of the world where
they plan to concentrate experienced document checkers and technology for
greater economy of scale.   </span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>A number of banks that have already established centralized
processing operations have gone further in offering their processing services
to other banks.  Bank of New York, First
Union now Wachovia, and Standard Chartered are just some of the banks that have
made a name for themselves in this role. 
Another example is Proponix, a newly established joint venture between  American Management Systems, Australia and
New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Bank of Montreal, and Barclays Bank PLC,
which has centralized the trade processing operations for three banks and plans
to insource trade processing from other banks as well.</span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>In terms of trade processing today most banks in the world
can be divided into three districts groups: Insourcers, Outsourcers and
Self-Processing Banks.  Insourcers are
banks that have made a strategic decision to insource trade processing from
other banks.  Outsourcers are banks that
have already outsourced their trade processing or are considering doing
so.  <br>
Self-Processing Banks are banks that do not outsource for various reasons and
need to continue processing business for their existing client base.   Such banks may be considering insourcing in
the future but not immediately. 
Although some banks have a clear strategy of what they want to do in
trade, most banks are undecided as to whether they will insource, outsource, or
maintain their current trade operations. </span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>Twenty-Eight major banks from North America, Europe, Asia,
and Australia were surveyed in May 2001 by an independent research company
commissioned by Proponix on topics ranging from annual spending on global
trade/finance operations and key challenges facing the industry, to the
greatest benefits of and barriers to outsourcing their global trade
processing.  The results of the research
as reported by <i>e-mmerce</i> magazine are interesting:</span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
-21.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";color:windowtext'>•        About half of the banks surveyed said
they spend more than US$10 million per year on global trade <br>
processing. </span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
-21.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";color:windowtext'>•        34% said technology is their biggest
challenge, followed by growing revenue (31%) and improving overall
profitability (27%) of their operations.</span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
-21.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";color:windowtext'>•        The three ‘most urgent’ technology
projects for global trade that the banks had undertaken recently, or plan to
soon, are: building internet front-end capabilities; installing new or updating
back office software; and updating legacy computer systems to meet customer
demands.</span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>•        The largest
benefit of outsourcing is lowering the price of each transaction (62%).</span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
-21.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";color:windowtext'>•        Of this group, 100% said outsourcing
would cut costs, with 41% stating the savings would be in the 20-30% range and
a further 12% stating the savings would exceed 30% annually.</span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
-21.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";color:windowtext'>•        More than half (52%) also said
outsourcing gives the bank access to the appropriate technology. </span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
-21.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";color:windowtext'>•        The global banks acknowledged
outsourcing could have customer sensitivity issues (62%) and create problems
with their existing, or legacy, computer systems (46%). But these barriers
could readily be overcome.</span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
-21.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";color:windowtext'>•        Two thirds (65%) said they would prefer

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>Insourcing of trade processing is not an easy task.  A few banks have learned this lesson the
hard way.  However, the market
opportunity is definitely there as confirmed by The Bank of New York, Proponix,
and others.  There are small and midsize
banks around the world that are prepared to outsource so long as there is no
threat of losing customers to the processing <br>
institution, and the technology is in place for a white-labeled solution with
customer service issues thought through.</span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>  </span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>According to Dr. Neil N. T. Tseng, Chairman of China Systems
Corporation, there are several key factors for the Insourcing Service Provider
to consider in order to be successful:</span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'> </span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>•        It has to be
compliant with local government regulations. </span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>•        It has to have
core competence in global trade services. </span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
-21.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";color:windowtext'>•        It has to eliminate the age-old concern
of the outsourcing banks that the insourcing service provider will not take
away their customers. </span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
-21.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";color:windowtext'>•        It has to offer an attractive fee
structure that generates more revenue than the outsourcing bank could earn by
keeping the processing in-house. </span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
-21.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";color:windowtext'>•        It has to utilize the power of the
Internet and build sophisticated interfaces to link with the existing systems
of the outsourcing banks and its clients for B2B STP processing and to improve
operation efficiency. </span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:left;text-indent:
-21.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";color:windowtext'>•        It has to invest heavily in hardware,
software, and communication bandwidth to fulfill its service level agreement. </span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>‘To utilize the power of the Internet, the Insourcing Service
Provider must refurbish its transaction processing system and document
management to support thin-client or web technology,’ states Dr. Tseng. </span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:windowtext'>Emerging e-Commerce trade solutions are not making the
decisions for banks easier largely because these solutions are new, and none to
date has gained wide market acceptance. 
Most banks are looking to their corporate customers to be the drivers
behind new technologies and are hesitant to dive into new business models.  Familiarity with digital certificates and
the eUCP rules should make the transition easier.    When discussing insourcing and outsourcing one should be clear
that insourcing of paper letters of credit is not new and has been happening
for years.  However, the insourcing of
electronic trade processing is new, and the Internet has changed the landscape
of the traditional issuing bank – advising bank environment.  CCEWeb’s @GlobalTrade™ solution is looking
to improve the efficiency of trade processing by eliminating the need for an
advising bank without changing the UCP rules, using PDF and digital signatures
as a means to move documents electronically or in combination with paper
documents.  The solution offered by
TradeCard aims to replace the letter of credit and the need for UCP by a new
payment instrument, where the risk of the buyer’s non-payment is secured by an
insurance company.  Bolero has focused its
solution around a central registry for handling documents of title
electronically together with other documents relating to a trade transaction
and developing their own XML standards. 
Although the goal of all three solutions is to improve the efficiency in
cross border trade, they have different approaches, price structures, and
business models.</span></p>

published on the Bolero web site, its system is secure and underpinned by a
unique legal structure that is maintained by a trusted third party.  All messages between the Bolero users are
validated and acknowledged, and notifications are provided as requested.
Additional messages determine whether the recipient accepts or refuses the
stated offer. The major feature is the Title Registry <br>

years and was launched commercially on September 27, 1999.  It has signed up a number of large financial
institutions, but was only able to complete a limited number of trade chains
that havesince tested its solution. 
Most banks interviewed by L/C Monitor said that Bolero’s price structure
is very expensive.  Although banks
applaud Bolero on their work done on standards for international trade, they
claim that Bolero’s rulebook is difficult to explain to customers and that implementation
work is complicated due to the need to purchase third party interfaces.  With the launch of  SURF, Bolero plans to build on the constructed components of the
Bolero <br>
service offering. The core messaging system 
allows trade data and documentation to be exchanged online in a secure environment.  Market reaction to SURF and the Bolero

trade transaction processes. By streamlining and enhancing the steps necessary
for purchase order approvals, payment decisions, and <br>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";

engine, the banks perceived  it as a

for letters of credit and replaced the L/C with a TradeCard payment instrument
makes trade finance bankers uncomfortable, to say the least.  TradeCard argues that L/Cs are too expensive
and paper intensive and that there must be a better way - and that is provided
by TradeCard.  A Canadian company CCEWeb
has challenged TradeCard’s argument by introducing a FastTrack electronic
documentary credit product in a similar price range as TradeCard. Unlike
TradeCard’s patented automatic compliance engine, CCEWeb’s @GlobalTrade system
still relies on the banks trade services operation to check for compliance of
electronic and/or paper documents manually as they always have done.</span></p>

<p class=body align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";

industry move forward and help evolve trade processing.  The telex was replaced with the fax machine,
and now we no longer ask for a person’s fax number but rather for their e-mail
address instead. In the same way, the need to send pieces of paper around the
world will be replaced with PDFs, Word, and other electronic formats that will be
secured with the sender’s digital identity. 
The trade finance bank will definitely play a major role in this
development.  The year 2002 should be
