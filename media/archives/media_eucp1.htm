<h1>eUCP WATCH</h1>

<h3>Are The Banks Ready?</span></h3>

<p>April is here and the Supplement for Electronic Presentation to the ICC’s UCP 500 (eUCP) is now in force.</p>

<p>eUCP accommodates presentation of electronic records alone or in combination with
paper documents.  Are the banks
ready?  L/C Monitor spoke to bankers in
Canada, Germany and Singapore to find out.</p>

<p>David Meynell, Vice President Trade &amp; Risk Services Deutsche Bank and member of
the eUCP Working Party said, ‘This is an important development on the road to
achieving collaborative electronic solutions in the world of documentary
credits. The ICC have provided the guidelines and it is now up to all parties
within the supply chain to ensure that interoperable solutions are established
and implemented, thereby allowing us to take advantage of the unique knowledge
management benefits of the internet.’</p>

<p>A prominent Canadian banker said that most banks in Canada are not ready yet.  ‘If the bank receives a documentary credit subject to eUCP after April 1st 2002, the standing instruction is to go back to the issuing bank requesting an amendment to delete reference
to eUCP in the credit.  There is no system at the moment to accommodate electronic presentation, said the banker
who wanted to remain anonymous.  A couple of banks in Canada have signed up with TradeCard but this has nothing to
do with eUCP and documentary credits.’</p>

<p>An influential German banker stated that a similar situation exists in Germany at
the moment and that some banks are considering CCEWeb’s @GlobalTrade solution
while others are evaluating the option of setting up bilateral agreements with
the large customers.  ‘This may be very
expensive since they would need to set up their own certification authorities
and infrastructure.  Some banks have
invested in Identrus but Identrus has yet to be accepted as an international
standard.  The challenge with digital
certificates is that, although from the technology point of view they are not a
problem, they become a problem when they need to be integrated with the bank’s
overall infrastructure.  The market
demand is not yet there to warrant the expenditures.’</p>

<p>A senior Singaporean banker said, ‘L/Cs issued by banks in Asia will still be
subject to the UCP 500 after the implementation of eUCP from 1 April 2002 as
they are not ready for the eUCP. It may take time for banks as well as traders
here to take part in the eUCP. However, the government in Singapore is more
proactive than the private sector. Who knows, one day the government of
Singapore may provide tax incentive for banks, traders, as well as trade
service providers to move towards paperless presentment of trade documents.’</p>

<p>One banker commented that ICC would need to do more education about eUCP,
recounting a story about an e-mail received from a correspondent bank where the
author of the email stated he was happy with the fact that now all credits that
were issued subject to UCP 500 were automatically subject to eUCP as well.  ‘I had to go back on the e-mail to reply that
in fact just the opposite was true.  Some
banks will start putting eUCP into their credits just because it is new not
knowing exactly what is behind it.’</p>

<p><b>eUCP Consulting</b></p>

<p>On March 13, 2002 CCEWeb Corp. (<a href="http://www.cceweb.com" target="_blank">www.cceweb.com</a>), the parent company of this
publication, announced that it will offer eUCP Consulting services addressing
issues that financial institutions have to deal with in order to start
accepting electronic presentations. Such issues include:</p>

<p>1.      How can secure electronic addresses be
provided <br>         to accommodate eUCP definition
for a place of <br>         presentation?</p>

<p>2.      How would customers ‘sign’ electronic
records? <br>         Who will provide them with
digital certificates?</p>

<p>3.      How are electronic records and paper
documents <br>         combined in one presentation?</p>

<p>4.      If the electronic record presented can not
be <br>         authenticated what are the bank’s
potential <br>         liabilities? How can a practical
solution for this <br>         be found that would not frustrate
clients and <br>         would increase the volume of
business?</p>

<p>‘CCEWeb has obtained know-how dealing with issues surrounding electronic presentation
while developing its @GlobalTrade Secure Payment and Trade Management System,’
said Jacob Katsman CCEWeb’s CEO.  ‘We
are one of the few companies in the world that has domain knowledge, IT expertise,
and hands-on experience working with various providers of authentication
software, digital certificates, and electronic document standards focused
specifically on trade services.’</p>

<p>@GlobalTrade is now being tested by a number of international banks, corporate customers,
and trade service providers. 
@GlobalTrade is 100 per cent eUCP compliant and offers an out-of-the-box
solution that does not require integration until trade volumes justify such
expenditures.  @GlobalTrade uses Adobe
PDF as a standard and can accommodate major digital certificate solutions such
as Entrust, Verisign, and Identrus.</p>
