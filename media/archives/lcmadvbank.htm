<H3>ROLE OF THE ADVISING BANK IN E-COMMERCE</H3>
<B>By: Jacob Katsman, L/C Monitor</B>


<P>Will the Advising Bank survive the Internet 
revolution? Some say no pointing to the following 
reasons:

<P>The paper advice of a letter of credit to the beneficiary can be substituted by secure electronic delivery. With Internet access, an authorized party could retrieve the credit instrument from any place in the world at anytime.

<P>Technology available today is able to replace 
traditional authenticator, test keys and signature 
directories in a more efficient and cost effective way. 
It can also ensure that the right beneficiary is receiving the letter of credit and the beneficiary is the only 
entity that can view the advice if so selected. 

<P>To achieve the desired result the issuance and 
advising functions have to be combined into one. The traditional documentary credit system allows for this to happen but the industry standard banking practice is entrenched in an issuing, advising, confirming 
2/3-bank system. 

<P>Can the Internet improve the standard banking 
practice? The quick answer is No. 
The Internet alone can not improve the standard 
banking practice without a system surrounding the 
information delivery process that fulfills the same needs as the traditional system and more. 

<P>What are these needs? The advising bank today has the following functions:
 
<UL>
<LI>Authentication of a letter of credit. Prior to 
	passing the credit into the hands of a beneficiary, the advising bank’s responsibility is to determine that the credit is genuine and has originated from 		a bank that purportedly issued the credit and not 
	from a post office. 
<LI>Scrutinization of a letter of credit. Review the 
	wording of the credit for inconsistencies and point them out to the beneficiary and/or clarify errors 
	with the issuing bank. This is, however, an option, not a requirement.

<LI>Advising of a letter of credit. Delivery of the credit 
	physically to the beneficiary, usually by fax, courier or airmail.
</UL>

<P>In many cases the advising bank does not engage 
itself in the credit transaction, and advises the credit 
‘without any responsibility on our part’ except in cases where it has been asked to act also as the confirming bank, the transfering bank, or the payment bank. In such majority of cases where the role of the advising bank is strictly advising it is not obligated to make 
payment to the beneficiary. Payment liabilities remain with the issuing bank. 

<P>In such multitude of cases, can the advising bank’s role be viewed as a glorified mailbox with redundant 
functions? 

<P>Wait, there is one more function that the advising bank has. 

<P>The advising bank is viewed by the seller as ‘my bank,’ ‘the bank that I trust.’ The seller, on the other hand, in today’s trading environment, views the issuing bank as the ‘buyer’s bank.’
Supposing that the issuing bank function is outsourced to a trusted third party that simultaneously acts as an advising bank, backed by an iron clad irrevocable 
guarantee of payment subject to the UCP rules, will the beneficiary form a different opinion?

<P>Consider an independant Documentary Clearance Center acting on behalf of various financial institutions around the world solely focused on processing letters of credit allowing various parties connected to a 
particular trade transaction to upload respective 
documents using the Internet. It will perform not only the issuing/advising function but also a consultative role authenticating the origin of the credit and 
allowing the seller to get paid quicker through 
submission of electronic documents without the need to integrate new software or learn new computer 
systems. 

<P>So what will the role of the advising bank be 
tomorrow?
