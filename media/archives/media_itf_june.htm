<h1><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;'>CCEWeb Signs European Deal<br>
Plans Full Launch in Early 2003</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Toronto-based CCEWeb Corp has signed
a strategic alliance with </span><span lang=EN-GB>Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young (CGEY) Germany, as
systems providers race to develop electronic, paperless trading frameworks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>CCEWeb said the deal means CGEY will market, pilot and integrate CCEWeb’s  internet-based trade processing and document
management system in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, introducing CCEWeb’s
@GlobalTrade™ secure payment and trade management System to importers, exporters,
banks and trade service providers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
lang=EN-GB>The
@GlobalTrade product enables the issuance of electronic letters of credit
(l/cs) and presentation of electronic and/or paper documents to the processing
bank, while allowing authorised parties to track the progress of transactions
online in real time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
lang=EN-GB>The system
has already been put through trials with banks in Europe, North America and
Asia, including a trial extending from April to August 2001 (ITF 385/4).  The latest of these – which have involved
all parties to a trade transaction – was completed in March 2002.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
lang=EN-GB>A
commercial launch is now planned “for </span><span lang=EN-GB>January 2003,” ITF was told by </span><span lang=EN-GB>Jacob Katsman, CCEWeb’s chief executive.  “Due to </span><span lang=EN-GB>9/11 and the general&nbsp;NASDAQ crash we felt
that there&nbsp;was no rush to come to market.&nbsp; It made more sense to
perfect the product and refine the business model,” he said, adding that </span><span
lang=EN-GB>other
alliances “are in the works, with major industry players.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
lang=EN-GB>Mr Katsman
said that @GlobalTrade is the first online business solution designed under the
requirements of the eUCP, the electronic supplement to the International
Chamber of Commerce’s (ICC) universally-used UCP500 rules for documentary
credits (ITF 404/6).  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span
lang=EN-GB>Distinguishing
the product </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
lang=EN-GB>He said that there are no membership
fees for<span style='color:blue'>&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>@GlobalTrade
participants, and that users would be charged transaction fees, depending on
what systems the banks have and what trade workflow products are being used,
such as letters of credit, collections, open account or cash in advance.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
lang=EN-GB>Mr Katsman said CCEWeb’s system
distinguished itself from competing systems, such as bolero.net.  “Banks think that Bolero’s pricing&nbsp;is
too high for the market”, he said, noting the annual membership fees and set-up
costs involved for connection and use of the bolero.net “core Messaging
Platform.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
lang=EN-GB>CCEWeb has also noted that bolero is
focused on larger corporations and multinationals, whereas the @GlobalTrade
system caters for small and large users alike. 
</span><span lang=EN-GB>TradeCard, on the other hand, is seen as lacking many accepted trade finance
market practices and standards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
lang=EN-GB>ChevronTexaco,
one of @GlobalTrade’s pilot users, has praised the product’s
accessibility.  Users require only
a  browser and Adobe Acrobat reader
software, and the electronic images of the documents strongly resemble their
paper equivalents, according to Ron Wells, a credit executive with
ChevronTexaco Global Trading. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
lang=EN-GB>CCEWeb
intends to provide a pilot run for all trial users, allowing them to gauge the
system and generating the feedback necessary to add fine-tunings to @GlobalTrade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
lang=EN-GB>Mr Katsman would not divulge
CCEWeb’s strategy to raise the profile of the product.  The company has </span><span lang=EN-GB>representatives in
different parts of the world, including Singapore, to market to companies and
banks.</span></p>
