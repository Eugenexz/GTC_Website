  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>‘We are calling the rules
  eUCP. It is important to stress that they supplement the UCP rules and in no
  way replace them. They are to be used in conjunction with UCP 500,’ Katz
  added.</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>ICC's rules governing
  documentary credits, the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary
  Credits, were first developed more than sixty years ago. The current version,
  issued in 1993, is known as UCP 500. </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The rules themselves
  state: ‘Where the eUCP applies, its provisions shall prevail to the extent
  that they would produce a result different from the application of the UCP.’</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Mr Katz noted that the
  parties wishing to use eUCP will specifically have to incorporate it into the
  credit. However, a credit subject to the eUCP is also subject to the UCP
  without the express incorporation of the UCP.</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The eUCP contains a
  number of definitions of terms that have different meanings in the electronic
  and paper-based contexts. Terms such ‘appears on its face’, ‘place for
  presentation,’ and ‘sign’ - all common features of the UCP - are redefined to
  take account of the electronic environment. </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>According to Mr Katz, the
  eUCP fills a big gap in the market. </span></p>
